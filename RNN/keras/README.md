## About RNNs

RNNs are mainly used for sequential or time-series applications. Feed forward or ordinary artificial NN works best at combinational or independent input data. 

RNNs have `memory` that enables them remember the previous results.

### Activation Function

AF's in RNNs are also known as `Transfer functions` and TFs are functions that basically functions that expresses, defines and interprets relationship between the output and input.

AF's can be of two types - `Linear` and `Non-linear`(Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU)

### Types of RNNs

 * 1-1
 * 1-N
 * N-1
 * N-N

In any neural network, a dense layer is a layer that is deeply connected with its preceding layer which means the neurons of the layer are connected to every neuron of its preceding layer. This layer is the most commonly used layer in artificial neural network networks.
